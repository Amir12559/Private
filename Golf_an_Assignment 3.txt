Golf 
Your assignment is to make a golf game.
In the application, the user controls a golf player trying to get a golf ball to the cup at the end of a course. You do this by selecting the angle of the ball’s trajectory, and the force you put behind the swing. The game ends when the ball is in the cup.
Required Features:

• The player should be able to launch the golf ball from its initial location, with a given angle (degrees from the ground up) and velocity (m/s at the start of the ball’s arc).
        ○ The angle and velocity should determine how far the ball travels, reducing the distance between the starting location and the cup.
        ○ Each swing should move the starting location for each arc.
        ○ Gravity should affect the ball while it travels, which should be used to determine the arc of the ball.
• The progress the player makes should be displayed between swings, showing the amount of swings the player has taken, as well as the distance to the cup.
        ○ If the ball travels beyond the cup, the new distance should still be positive.
• When the ball has reached the goal, the game should end, displaying all swings taken, and how far the ball travelled each time.
• If the ball moves too far away from the cup, the game should generate an exception that takes you out of the game loop, with a failure message.
• If too many swings have been taken, the game should end, with a different failure message.

Resources:

• https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/linq-fundamentals-csharp-6/table-of-contents
• Algorithms:
        ○ Angle In Radians: (Math.PI / 180) * angle
        ○ Distance: Math.Pow(velocity, 2) / GRAVITY * Math.Sin(2 * angleInRadians)
• Gravity is equal to 9.8
• Example: At 45 Degrees and 56 m/s, the ball should travel 320 meters.
